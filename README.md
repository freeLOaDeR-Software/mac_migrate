# mac_migrate
Shell scripts to facilitate getting settings that are not migrated with the assistant so you can choose what to bring over

What to expect:
shebang will point to zsh
Scripts are written to comply with syntax:
- BSD
- Bash

In most cases, they will be written one line per function and feed to a variable in order to make it easy to understand, learn and cannibalize to your own scripts
